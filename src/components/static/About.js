                <p>My name is Leila Khan. I grew up in a small town called Labasa in Fiji and now I call Auckland, New Zealand home. I am so in love with Auckland. It’s beautifully insane. It’s a place where I came and my  dreams did come true. </p>

                <p>I love my city, I love it with all my heart. I wouldn’t have anything if it wasn’t for this city.
                I appreciate the fleeting beauty that is all around us. I do my very best when taking photos to capture it’s raw beauty.
                </p>

                <p> As an avid food lover and amateur chef, I take photos of food when dining out and of all creations from my kitchen.
                    I stand for equal human rights and dedicated in spreading the light. It’s contagious.
                </p>

                <p>Note: Unless specified, all photos are taken by me - if you would like to use them, please credit.</p>
